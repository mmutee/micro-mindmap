You will need to grab the D3 Javascript library, place it in the same folder as the HTML file to make it work offline.
Or edit the HTML and change this line
>```<script src="d3.v7.min.js"></script>```
To this
```<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>```

Single click on any node to create a sub-node

Right click on a node to delete it

Alt-Click to rename a node

Ctl-Click to mark task as done

Shift-Click to highlight a node
